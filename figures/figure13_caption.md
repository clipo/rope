# Figure 13. Rope production investment analysis for moai transport.

Four-panel analysis of labor and material requirements for rope production across moai sizes, based on experimental data from Folk (2018) and traditional fiber processing methods.

**(A) Fiber Requirements:** Total fiber mass (kg) required for three 30-meter ropes (2 lateral transport ropes, 1 stabilizing rope) scales quadratically with moai mass. Paro (82 tons) required approximately 101 kg of processed fiber, representing 2.7Ã— the investment of a 4.3-ton experimental replica.

**(B) Production Timeline:** Time required for complete rope production from harvesting through construction. Most time is spent in water retting (38 days), which can be parallelized across multiple fiber batches. Total production time ranges from 71 days (experimental replica) to 121 days (Paro).

**(C) Labor Investment per Rope Set:** Person-days of labor required to produce one complete set of three ropes. Values range from 83 person-days (4.3-ton replica) to 277 person-days (Paro, 82 tons). Labor includes harvesting, processing, retting management, and rope construction.

**(D) Cumulative Investment for 6 km Transport:** Total person-days required for rope production assuming 4 rope sets per 6 km transport distance (rope lifetime ~1.5 km based on experimental wear rates). For Paro, the total investment of 1,109 person-days represents approximately 1.5 days of community labor capacity (assuming population of 3,000-4,000 and 20% working-age labor participation).

**Key Finding:** Rope production requirements were well within community capacity for all transported moai, including the largest specimens. The data demonstrate that rope production was not a limiting factor in moai transport feasibility.

**Note:** Rope diameter calculations assume fiber tensile strength of 916 MPa, 65% fiber packing efficiency, 75% construction efficiency, safety factor of 10, and working load of 1 kN per ton of moai mass.
