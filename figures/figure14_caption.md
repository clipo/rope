# Figure 14. Comparative rope production investment across moai size categories.

Visual comparison of rope production requirements demonstrating the feasibility of rope-based moai transport. The figure shows five moai specimens scaled by mass (top panel) with associated rope requirements and production metrics (bottom panels).

**Top Panel:** Moai silhouettes scaled proportionally by mass from experimental replica (4.3 tons, green) through typical platform moai (18 tons, blue), large specimens (40 and 60 tons, purple and orange), to Paro (82 tons, red), the largest successfully transported moai. Each statue is annotated with required rope diameter and total fiber mass needed.

**Bottom Panels (left to right):**

1. **Production Time:** Days required for complete rope production from harvesting through construction (70-102 days). Time scales modestly with moai size due to parallelizable retting process.

2. **Labor per Set:** Person-days required to produce one complete rope set (3 ropes, 30 m each). Values range from 78 person-days (experimental) to 218 person-days (Paro), representing a 2.7Ã— scaling factor.

3. **6 km Transport:** Cumulative person-days for rope production assuming 4 rope sets per 6 km transport (rope lifetime ~1.5 km). Maximum investment for Paro = 871 person-days, equivalent to 124% of daily community labor capacity.

**Key Context:** With estimated island population of 3,000-4,000 during peak moai transport period and assuming 20% working-age labor participation, daily community labor capacity was approximately 600-800 person-days. The rope investment for Paro (871 person-days distributed over 102 production days) represents only 1.2 days of total community capacity. This demonstrates that rope production was highly feasible even for the largest transported specimens.

**Conclusion:** Size limits for moai transport reflect physiological constraints on rope handling (grip capability, coordination) rather than material availability or production capacity. Rope production was never a limiting factor in moai transport feasibility.

**Note:** Rope diameters calculated assuming fiber tensile strength of 916 MPa, 65% fiber packing efficiency, 75% construction efficiency, safety factor of 10, and working load of 1 kN per ton of moai mass.
