# Figure 9. Tensile strength scaling and required rope diameters for moai transport.

**(A)** Breaking load increases quadratically with rope diameter for T. cordifolia rope (fiber strength of 916 MPa, 65% fiber packing efficiency, 75% construction efficiency). The working load requirements for 4-ton and 80-ton moai are indicated, along with a safety margin assuming a factor of 8. Specific values marked for 10 mm (35 kN) and 45 mm (710 kN) rope diameters demonstrate the relationship Breaking Load (kN) = 0.35 × D².

**(B)** Required rope diameter as a function of moai mass, assuming a safety factor of 10. Paro (82 tons) requires a 48 mm-diameter rope under these assumptions, approaching the practical handling limit of 50 mm for human hands.
