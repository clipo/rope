# Figure 12. Rope diameter requirements and transport feasibility limits.

**(A)** Required rope diameter for specific moai specimens with two safety factor scenarios (SF=10 in solid colors, SF=5 with hatching). Colors indicate transport status: green = experimental replica (Hunt & Lipo, 2011), blue = typical transported specimen (Ahu Akivi), orange = largest successfully transported specimens (Paro, 82 tons; Ahu Tongariki, 90 tons), red = untransported quarry specimen (Te Tokanga, 260 tons). Horizontal reference lines indicate grip difficulty thresholds: 40 mm (difficult), 50 mm (practical limit), and 70 mm (physiologically impossible). With standard safety factors (SF=10), Paro requires 48 mm diameter rope, approaching the practical handling limit.

**(B)** Continuous relationship between moai mass and required rope diameter across the full range of documented specimens. Shaded zones indicate handling feasibility: green (comfortable, 0-40 mm), orange (difficult, 40-50 mm), and red (exceeds practical limits, >50 mm). The curves demonstrate that even with reduced safety factors (SF=5), moai exceeding approximately 150 tons would require rope diameters beyond human grip capability. All successfully transported moai fall below the 50 mm threshold (Paro at 48 mm, Ahu Tongariki at 51 mm approaches it), while untransported quarry specimens like Te Tokanga (260 tons) would require 86 mm diameter rope with SF=10, far exceeding physiological constraints.

**Note:** Calculations assume fiber tensile strength of 916 MPa, 65% fiber packing efficiency, 75% construction efficiency, and working load of 1 kN per ton of moai mass.
