# Figure 10. Human hand grip capability versus required rope diameters.

Horizontal bars indicate comfortable grip range (green) and maximum grip capability (orange) for five hand size categories based on typical adult hand circumference distributions (180-220 mm). Vertical lines mark required rope diameters for moai of different masses, calculated assuming safety factor of 10, fiber tensile strength of 916 MPa, 65% packing efficiency, and 75% construction efficiency. Rope diameters of 11 mm (4 ton moai) and 21 mm (15 ton moai) fall well within the comfortable grip range, while an 80-ton moai requires 48 mm diameter rope, approaching the practical handling limit. Paro, the largest transported moai (82 tons), requires 48 mm diameter rope, similarly approaching the 50 mm maximum handling threshold. The shaded red region indicates rope sizes that exceed practical handling capability, demonstrating that rope-based transport of the largest moai specimens approached fundamental physiological constraints on human grip.
