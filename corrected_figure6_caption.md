# Corrected Caption for Figure 6

## Original (PROBLEMATIC):
Rope diameter requirements across the documented spectrum of moai sizes. The upper panel compares specific named specimens showing the required rope diameter with safety factors of 10 (solid bars) and 5 (hatched bars). Color coding indicates transport status: green (experimental replica), blue (successfully transported typical specimens), **orange (successfully transported at technological limits)**, red (never transported). Horizontal lines mark the comfortable grip range (below 40 mm), the maximum grip limit (50 mm), and the physically impossible threshold (70 mm). The lower panel presents a continuous relationship between moai mass and required rope diameter, with documented specimens plotted as individual points. Shaded zones indicate the feasible range (green), **the difficult range requiring maximum effort (orange)**, and the impossible range exceeding grip capability (red). The vertical line at 90 tons marks the observed transport limit, beyond which successfully transported specimens end. Te Tokanga at 260 tons requires rope diameter (69 mm with a safety factor of 10, 49 mm with a safety factor of 5) that exceeds physiological constraints on rope handling.

## Corrected Version:
Rope diameter requirements across the documented spectrum of moai sizes. The upper panel compares specific named specimens showing the required rope diameter with safety factors of 10 (solid bars) and 5 (hatched bars). Color coding indicates transport status: green (experimental replica), blue (successfully transported typical specimens), **orange (largest successfully transported specimens, approaching but not exceeding handling limits)**, red (never transported). Horizontal lines mark the comfortable grip range (below 40 mm), the maximum grip limit (50 mm), and the physically impossible threshold (70 mm). The lower panel presents a continuous relationship between moai mass and required rope diameter, with documented specimens plotted as individual points. Shaded zones indicate the feasible range (green), **the challenging range approaching limits (orange, 40-50 mm)**, and the impossible range exceeding grip capability (red, >50 mm). The vertical line at 90 tons marks the observed transport limit, beyond which successfully transported specimens end. **Notably, the largest transported moai (Paro and Ahu Tongariki, 86-90 tons) required rope diameters of only 40-41 mm, remaining within practical handling limits and suggesting that rope technology was not the limiting constraint on moai transport at these sizes.** Te Tokanga at 260 tons requires rope diameter (69 mm with a safety factor of 10, 49 mm with a safety factor of 5) that exceeds physiological constraints on rope handling.

## Key Changes:

1. **"orange (successfully transported at technological limits)"** → **"orange (largest successfully transported specimens, approaching but not exceeding handling limits)"**
   - The original falsely implied these moai were at the limits of rope technology
   - At 40-41 mm, they're still 9-10 mm below the 50 mm practical limit

2. **"the difficult range requiring maximum effort (orange)"** → **"the challenging range approaching limits (orange, 40-50 mm)"**
   - More accurate characterization - these were challenging but not at maximum limits
   - Added specific range (40-50 mm) for clarity

3. **Added new sentence**: "Notably, the largest transported moai (Paro and Ahu Tongariki, 86-90 tons) required rope diameters of only 40-41 mm, remaining within practical handling limits and suggesting that rope technology was not the limiting constraint on moai transport at these sizes."
   - **This is the critical insight**: Rope technology was NOT the bottleneck
   - Makes the key finding explicit for readers

4. **Te Tokanga values verified correct**: 69 mm (SF=10) and 49 mm (SF=5) ✓

## Why This Matters:

### Original Interpretation (INCORRECT):
- Largest transported moai were "at technological limits"
- The "difficult range requiring maximum effort" included successfully transported moai
- Implied rope technology was barely adequate for 80-90 ton moai

### Corrected Interpretation:
- Largest transported moai were well within practical limits (40-41 mm vs 50 mm limit)
- Successfully transported moai were in the "challenging" range but not at limits
- **Rope technology was NOT the limiting factor** - other constraints (logistics, workforce, social organization, terrain) must explain why transport stopped at ~90 tons
- Only massive untransported quarry moai (260+ tons) actually exceed rope technology capabilities

## Data Verification:
- Paro (86 tons): 39.9 mm ≈ 40 mm ✓
- Ahu Tongariki (90 tons): 40.8 mm ≈ 41 mm ✓
- Both are **9-10 mm below** the 50 mm practical limit
- Te Tokanga (260 tons): 69.4 mm (SF=10), 49.1 mm (SF=5) ✓
