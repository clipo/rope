## FIGURE 3: Tensile Strength Scaling and Required Rope Diameters

### ❌ ORIGINAL (INCORRECT):
Tensile strength scaling and required rope diameters for moai transport. (A) Breaking load increases quadratically with rope diameter for Triumfetta cordifolia rope (fiber strength of 916 MPa, 75% construction efficiency). The working load requirements for 4-ton and 80-ton moai are indicated, along with a safety margin assuming a factor of 8. Specific values marked for 10 mm (32 kN) and 45 mm (650 kN) rope diameters. (B) Required rope diameter as a function of moai mass, assuming a safety factor of 10. The 50 mm practical handling limit is exceeded for moai weighing approximately 60 tons or more. **Paro (86 tons) requires a 57 mm-diameter rope** under these assumptions, substantially exceeding the comfortable grip capability.

### ✅ CORRECTED:
Tensile strength scaling and required rope diameters for moai transport. (A) Breaking load increases quadratically with rope diameter for Triumfetta cordifolia rope (fiber strength of 916 MPa, 75% construction efficiency). The working load requirements for 4-ton and 80-ton moai are indicated, along with a safety margin assuming a factor of 8. Specific values marked for 10 mm (32 kN) and **45 mm (1,093 kN)** rope diameters. (B) Required rope diameter as a function of moai mass, assuming a safety factor of 10. The 50 mm practical handling limit is exceeded for moai weighing approximately 60 tons or more. **Paro (86 tons) requires a 40 mm-diameter rope** under these assumptions, **approaching but not exceeding the comfortable grip capability**.

### Changes Made:
- 45 mm breaking load: **650 kN → 1,093 kN**
- Paro rope diameter: **57 mm → 40 mm**
- Status: **"substantially exceeding" → "approaching but not exceeding"**

## FIGURE 4: Human Hand Grip Capability vs Required Rope Diameters

### ❌ ORIGINAL (INCORRECT):
Human hand grip capability versus required rope diameters. Horizontal bars indicate comfortable grip range (green) and maximum grip capability (orange) for five hand size categories based on typical adult hand circumference distributions (180-220 mm). Vertical lines mark required rope diameters for moai of different masses. Rope diameters of 10-20 mm fall well within the comfortable grip range, while **45-57 mm diameters are necessary for the largest moai and exceed practical handling limits** for sustained pulling tasks. The shaded red region indicates rope sizes that cannot be gripped securely.

### ✅ CORRECTED:
Human hand grip capability versus required rope diameters. Horizontal bars indicate comfortable grip range (green) and maximum grip capability (orange) for five hand size categories based on typical adult hand circumference distributions (180-220 mm). Vertical lines mark required rope diameters for moai of different masses. Rope diameters of 10-20 mm fall well within the comfortable grip range, while **40 mm diameter rope is necessary for the largest transported moai (Paro, 86 tons) and remains within practical handling limits (50 mm maximum). Only untransported quarry moai exceeding 150 tons would require rope diameters beyond comfortable grip capability**. The shaded red region indicates rope sizes that cannot be gripped securely.

### Changes Made:
- Rope diameter for largest moai: **"45-57 mm" → "40 mm"**
- Status: **"exceed practical handling limits" → "remains within practical handling limits"**
- Added clarification about what actually exceeds limits

## FIGURE 5: Rope Requirements Across Moai Transport Scenarios

### ❌ ORIGINAL (INCORRECT):
Rope requirements across documented moai categories. Three parameters are compared for moai found in quarry (incomplete), along roads (abandoned during transport), on platforms (successfully transported), and Paro specifically: required rope diameter (blue), typical moai mass (orange), and estimated people per rope team (green). **Transport of Paro requires a rope diameter (57 mm) that exceeds the 50 mm practical handling limit, necessitating modified transport strategies, such as using multiple smaller ropes, reducing safety factors, or optimizing fiber processing.**

### ✅ CORRECTED:
Rope requirements across documented moai categories. Three parameters are compared for moai found in quarry (incomplete), along roads (abandoned during transport), on platforms (successfully transported), and Paro specifically: required rope diameter (blue), typical moai mass (orange), and estimated people per rope team (green). **Transport of Paro requires a rope diameter (40 mm) that remains within the 50 mm practical handling limit, demonstrating that rope technology was feasible for the largest successfully transported moai using standard construction methods and safety factors.**

### Changes Made:
- Paro rope diameter: **57 mm → 40 mm**
- Status: **"exceeds the 50 mm practical handling limit" → "remains within the 50 mm practical handling limit"**
- **REMOVED ENTIRELY**: "necessitating modified transport strategies..." (invalid speculation based on incorrect data)
- Added correct interpretation about rope technology feasibility

## FIGURE 6: Rope Diameter Requirements Across the Documented Spectrum of Moai Sizes

### ❌ ORIGINAL (PROBLEMATIC):
Rope diameter requirements across the documented spectrum of moai sizes. The upper panel compares specific named specimens showing the required rope diameter with safety factors of 10 (solid bars) and 5 (hatched bars). Color coding indicates transport status: green (experimental replica), blue (successfully transported typical specimens), **orange (successfully transported at technological limits)**, red (never transported). Horizontal lines mark the comfortable grip range (below 40 mm), the maximum grip limit (50 mm), and the physically impossible threshold (70 mm). The lower panel presents a continuous relationship between moai mass and required rope diameter, with documented specimens plotted as individual points. Shaded zones indicate the feasible range (green), **the difficult range requiring maximum effort (orange)**, and the impossible range exceeding grip capability (red). The vertical line at 90 tons marks the observed transport limit, beyond which successfully transported specimens end. Te Tokanga at 260 tons requires rope diameter (69 mm with a safety factor of 10, 49 mm with a safety factor of 5) that exceeds physiological constraints on rope handling.

### ✅ CORRECTED:
Rope diameter requirements across the documented spectrum of moai sizes. The upper panel compares specific named specimens showing the required rope diameter with safety factors of 10 (solid bars) and 5 (hatched bars). Color coding indicates transport status: green (experimental replica), blue (successfully transported typical specimens), **orange (largest successfully transported specimens, approaching but not exceeding handling limits)**, red (never transported). Horizontal lines mark the comfortable grip range (below 40 mm), the maximum grip limit (50 mm), and the physically impossible threshold (70 mm). The lower panel presents a continuous relationship between moai mass and required rope diameter, with documented specimens plotted as individual points. Shaded zones indicate the feasible range (green), **the challenging range approaching limits (orange, 40-50 mm)**, and the impossible range exceeding grip capability (red, >50 mm). The vertical line at 90 tons marks the observed transport limit, beyond which successfully transported specimens end. **Notably, the largest transported moai (Paro and Ahu Tongariki, 86-90 tons) required rope diameters of only 40-41 mm, remaining within practical handling limits and suggesting that rope technology was not the limiting constraint on moai transport at these sizes.** Te Tokanga at 260 tons requires rope diameter (69 mm with a safety factor of 10, 49 mm with a safety factor of 5) that exceeds physiological constraints on rope handling.

### Changes Made:
- Orange color interpretation: **"at technological limits" → "approaching but not exceeding handling limits"**
- Orange zone description: **"difficult range requiring maximum effort" → "challenging range approaching limits (40-50 mm)"**
- **Added explicit range** for orange zone: (40-50 mm)
- **Added critical new sentence**: Explicitly states that Paro/Ahu Tongariki remained within limits and rope technology was NOT the constraint

## SUMMARY OF ERRORS CORRECTED

### Systematic Error:
All captions incorrectly stated or implied that Paro required 57 mm diameter rope. The actual requirement is **40 mm**.

### Impact of Error:
- **57 mm** would exceed the 50 mm practical handling limit ❌
- **40 mm** remains within the 50 mm practical handling limit ✅

### Calculation Verification:
```
Paro (86 tons, Safety Factor = 10):
Working load = 86 kN
Required breaking load = 860 kN
Required diameter = 2 × √(860,000 N / (916 MPa × π × 0.75))
                  = 39.94 mm ≈ 40 mm ✅
```

### Key Finding (Corrected):
**Rope technology was NOT the limiting constraint for transporting 80-90 ton moai.** The largest successfully transported specimens (Paro: 86 tons, Ahu Tongariki: 90 tons) required rope diameters of only 40-41 mm, which is well within the 50 mm practical handling limit. Only massive untransported quarry moai (260+ tons) exceed rope technology capabilities.

### Implications:
Other factors (logistics, workforce organization, terrain, social/political constraints) must explain why moai transport stopped at ~90 tons, not rope technology limitations.
