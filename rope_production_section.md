# Rope Production Investment and Feasibility

## Labor and Time Requirements for Rope Production

While tensile strength determines whether rope *can* support moai transport loads, practical feasibility depends equally on whether communities could produce sufficient cordage within reasonable timeframes. Experimental rope production documented by Folk (2018) provides quantitative parameters for estimating the labor investment required to manufacture rope assemblies for different moai transport scenarios.

Their experimental protocol using Tilia americana (basswood) as a proxy for Rapa Nui fiber sources yielded approximately 6,000 grams of usable fiber from two trees averaging 23.5 meters height and 21.75 cm base diameter. Processing involved linear bark stripping, submersion retting for 38 days in flowing water, and subsequent rope construction by teams of 2-4 people. A 4-meter rope segment consumed approximately 1,200 grams of processed fiber, establishing a baseline conversion ratio of 300 grams per meter for rope of approximately 25mm diameter.

Scaling these experimental parameters to the range of rope diameters required for moai transport (9-40mm for the transported specimens) reveals systematic relationships between statue mass and production investment (Figure 7). For a 4.3 ton experimental replica requiring three 30-meter ropes of 9mm diameter, total fiber requirements reach approximately 3.4 kg. A typical platform moai of 18 tons demands 14.4 kg of processed fiber for equivalent rope lengths. Paro, at 86 tons requiring 40mm diameter rope, necessitates 68.9 kg of fiber—a twentyfold increase over the experimental case.

### Production Timeline and Critical Path Analysis

The rope production sequence comprises four distinct stages with different time and labor characteristics (Figure 7B). Fiber harvesting and initial processing, estimated at 0.5 days per kilogram based on traditional practices documented ethnographically, scales linearly with rope diameter requirements. For the experimental moai, this stage requires approximately 1.7 days; for Paro, it extends to 34.4 days with a team of three workers.

Retting constitutes the time-limiting step at 38 days regardless of batch size, though multiple batches can be processed in parallel. This fixed duration means that with advance planning, retting does not extend the critical path proportionally for larger moai. Drying and preparation add approximately 3 days as a relatively constant component.

Rope construction time scales with total rope length and diameter, estimated at 0.3 days per meter of finished rope for teams of 2-4 people. Three 30-meter ropes for the experimental moai require approximately 27 days of construction time; for Paro's larger-diameter rope, this extends to 41 days accounting for the additional labor intensity of handling and twisting thicker fiber assemblies.

Cumulative production timelines range from 70 days for the experimental moai to 102 days for Paro (Figure 7B). However, this represents calendar time, not labor investment. Converting to person-days—the more relevant metric for assessing community resource allocation—reveals that production of one rope set requires 78 person-days for a 4.3 ton moai but 218 person-days for Paro (Figure 7C). This near-threefold increase reflects both greater fiber mass and the additional labor intensity of constructing larger-diameter rope.

### Rope Replacement and Transport Distance Economics

Rope performance degrades through repeated loading cycles, abrasion at contact points, and environmental exposure during transport. Conservative estimates suggest rope assemblies might sustain 1-2 km of transport before requiring replacement to maintain adequate safety margins. For an average transport distance of 6 km from Rano Raraku quarry to platform sites (Lipo and Hunt 2025), this degradation cycle necessitates 4-5 rope sets per moai.

The cumulative labor investment therefore scales dramatically with both moai mass and transport distance (Figure 7D). Transporting the experimental moai 6 km requires approximately 311 person-days of rope production labor. A typical 18-ton platform moai demands 427 person-days. For Paro transported 6 km to Ahu Te Pito Kura, cumulative rope production investment reaches approximately 871 person-days.

These person-day estimates represent rope production labor exclusively, not including the transport operation itself. For comparison, Hunt and Lipo (2011) demonstrated that 18 people could move a 4.35-ton moai experimental replica using the walking method. Assuming a transport rate of 100 meters per hour—consistent with their experimental observations—moving a moai 6 km would require approximately 60 hours of transport labor, or roughly 15 person-days per rope team (assuming 3 teams). The rope production investment (311 person-days for the experimental case) exceeds the direct transport labor by approximately 20:1, indicating that cordage manufacture, rather than the physical moving operation, dominated the labor economics of moai transport.

### Implications for Transport Feasibility

The scaling relationships documented in Figure 7 illuminate why transported moai exhibit an upper size limit near 90 tons. Beyond the physiological rope-handling constraints discussed in Section [X], the exponential increase in rope production investment creates practical limits on what communities could reasonably undertake.

For context, Rapa Nui's population during the statue-building period (approximately 1200-1500 CE) is estimated at 3,000-4,000 people. A community of 3,500 people with 20% of the population engaged in productive labor (accounting for children, elderly, and other exclusions) would have approximately 700 person-days of labor available per day. Producing ropes for Paro's transport—871 person-days cumulative investment over 6 km—represents approximately 1.2 days of community labor capacity, clearly within feasible bounds.

However, this calculation assumes ropes are produced as needed, exploiting the parallelizable nature of retting to maintain continuous production pipelines. If rope production concentrated into intensive campaigns, the 38-day retting period becomes rate-limiting, constraining throughput regardless of available labor. Multiple parallel retting operations using different water sources or sequential staging could partially mitigate this constraint.

The fiber harvest requirements also remain modest relative to available hau hau resources. Assuming Triumfetta biomass productivity similar to documented ranges for T. cordifolia (Senwitz et al. 2016), and considering that hau hau colonizes disturbed ground rapidly, the 69 kg of fiber required for Paro represents a trivial fraction of total available biomass on an island where forest clearance was creating expanding areas of ideal hau hau habitat (Hunt and Lipo 2025).

### Material Constraints vs. Organizational Constraints

The quantitative analysis of rope production investment demonstrates that material and labor availability did not constrain moai transport feasibility. Even for the largest transported specimens, fiber requirements, production timelines, and labor investments remained well within the capacity of plausible Rapa Nui communities during the statue-construction period. The limiting factors for moai size and transport distance emerged instead from:

1. **Rope handling constraints** (physiological limits on grippable diameter approaching 50mm)
2. **Coordination complexity** (managing multiple rope teams, timing, and synchronization)
3. **Transport infrastructure** (road width and surface preparation requirements)
4. **Risk assessment** (acceptable failure rates given the exponential decline in success probability with distance and mass)

These factors align with the archaeological evidence showing that most moai along roads weigh less than 20 tons, with specimens exceeding 40 tons becoming increasingly rare and concentrated closer to the quarry (Lipo and Hunt 2025). The rope production analysis indicates this distribution reflects organizational and logistical optimization rather than material scarcity or technological limitation.
