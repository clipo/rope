# Corrected Caption for Figure 3

## Original (INCORRECT):
Tensile strength scaling and required rope diameters for moai transport. (A) Breaking load increases quadratically with rope diameter for Triumfetta cordifolia rope (fiber strength of 916 MPa, 75% construction efficiency). The working load requirements for 4-ton and 80-ton moai are indicated, along with a safety margin assuming a factor of 8. Specific values marked for 10 mm (32 kN) and 45 mm (650 kN) rope diameters. (B) Required rope diameter as a function of moai mass, assuming a safety factor of 10. The 50 mm practical handling limit is exceeded for moai weighing approximately 60 tons or more. **Paro (86 tons) requires a 57 mm-diameter rope** under these assumptions, substantially exceeding the comfortable grip capability.

## Corrected Version:
Tensile strength scaling and required rope diameters for moai transport. (A) Breaking load increases quadratically with rope diameter for Triumfetta cordifolia rope (fiber strength of 916 MPa, 75% construction efficiency). The working load requirements for 4-ton and 80-ton moai are indicated, along with a safety margin assuming a factor of 8. Specific values marked for 10 mm (32 kN) and 45 mm (1,093 kN) rope diameters. (B) Required rope diameter as a function of moai mass, assuming a safety factor of 10. The 50 mm practical handling limit is exceeded for moai weighing approximately 60 tons or more. **Paro (86 tons) requires a 40 mm-diameter rope** under these assumptions, approaching but not exceeding the comfortable grip capability.

## Key Changes:
1. **57 mm → 40 mm** for Paro's required rope diameter
2. **"substantially exceeding" → "approaching but not exceeding"** to reflect that 40 mm is close to but still under the 50 mm practical limit
3. **650 kN → 1,093 kN** for the 45 mm rope breaking load (this was also incorrect in the original caption)

## Calculation Verification:
- Paro mass: 86 tons
- Working load: 86,000 N (86 kN)
- Required breaking load (SF=10): 860 kN
- Required diameter: **39.92 mm ≈ 40 mm**

This is calculated from: d = 2 × √(Breaking_load / (σ × π × η))
where σ = 916 MPa, η = 0.75
