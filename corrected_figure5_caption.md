# Corrected Caption for Figure 5

## Original (INCORRECT):
Rope requirements across documented moai categories. Three parameters are compared for moai found in quarry (incomplete), along roads (abandoned during transport), on platforms (successfully transported), and Paro specifically: required rope diameter (blue), typical moai mass (orange), and estimated people per rope team (green). **Transport of Paro requires a rope diameter (57 mm) that exceeds the 50 mm practical handling limit, necessitating modified transport strategies, such as using multiple smaller ropes, reducing safety factors, or optimizing fiber processing.**

## Corrected Version:
Rope requirements across documented moai categories. Three parameters are compared for moai found in quarry (incomplete), along roads (abandoned during transport), on platforms (successfully transported), and Paro specifically: required rope diameter (blue), typical moai mass (orange), and estimated people per rope team (green). **Transport of Paro requires a rope diameter (40 mm) that remains within the 50 mm practical handling limit, demonstrating that rope technology was feasible for the largest successfully transported moai using standard construction methods and safety factors.**

## Key Changes:
1. **"57 mm"** → **"40 mm"** (corrected actual calculated value)
2. **"that exceeds the 50 mm practical handling limit"** → **"that remains within the 50 mm practical handling limit"** (CRITICAL correction - completely reverses the conclusion!)
3. **Removed**: "necessitating modified transport strategies, such as using multiple smaller ropes, reducing safety factors, or optimizing fiber processing" - This entire speculation is INVALID because Paro does NOT exceed the limit
4. **Added**: "demonstrating that rope technology was feasible for the largest successfully transported moai using standard construction methods and safety factors" - Provides the correct interpretation

## Why This Matters:
The original caption incorrectly suggested that:
- Paro required 57 mm rope (FALSE - it's 40 mm)
- This exceeded practical limits (FALSE - 40 mm is 10 mm BELOW the 50 mm limit)
- Special workarounds were needed (FALSE - standard methods were sufficient)

The corrected caption shows that:
- Paro was well within rope technology capabilities
- No special modifications were required
- Rope technology was NOT a limiting factor for 80-90 ton moai transport
- Other factors (logistics, workforce, terrain) must explain transport limits, not rope diameter constraints
