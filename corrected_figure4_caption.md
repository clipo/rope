# Corrected Caption for Figure 4

## Original (INCORRECT):
Human hand grip capability versus required rope diameters. Horizontal bars indicate comfortable grip range (green) and maximum grip capability (orange) for five hand size categories based on typical adult hand circumference distributions (180-220 mm). Vertical lines mark required rope diameters for moai of different masses. Rope diameters of 10-20 mm fall well within the comfortable grip range, while **45-57 mm diameters are necessary for the largest moai and exceed practical handling limits** for sustained pulling tasks. The shaded red region indicates rope sizes that cannot be gripped securely.

## Corrected Version:
Human hand grip capability versus required rope diameters. Horizontal bars indicate comfortable grip range (green) and maximum grip capability (orange) for five hand size categories based on typical adult hand circumference distributions (180-220 mm). Vertical lines mark required rope diameters for moai of different masses. Rope diameters of 10-20 mm fall well within the comfortable grip range, while **40 mm diameter rope is necessary for the largest transported moai (Paro, 86 tons) and remains within practical handling limits (50 mm maximum). Only untransported quarry moai exceeding 150 tons would require rope diameters beyond comfortable grip capability**. The shaded red region indicates rope sizes that cannot be gripped securely.

## Key Changes:
1. **"45-57 mm diameters"** → **"40 mm diameter rope"** (corrected the actual requirement for Paro)
2. **"exceed practical handling limits"** → **"remains within practical handling limits (50 mm maximum)"** (this is the critical correction - Paro does NOT exceed limits!)
3. Added clarification: **"Only untransported quarry moai exceeding 150 tons would require rope diameters beyond comfortable grip capability"** (provides context for what actually exceeds limits)

## Why This Matters:
The original caption incorrectly implied that the largest transported moai (Paro, Ahu Tongariki) exceeded practical rope handling limits. This is FALSE. At 40 mm, these moai were still 10 mm below the 50 mm practical handling limit, suggesting that rope technology was NOT the limiting factor for their transport.
